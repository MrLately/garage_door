i uploaded icon.png via thonny through files/upload to.

there is a function to serve the manifest but could have possibly put an actual manifest.json but figured micropython is best left micro.

in the loop is if manifest.json... elif image... continue.

this is for the pwa. when you afd to homesceen on ios or android it requests manifest json so this is how i serve it.
